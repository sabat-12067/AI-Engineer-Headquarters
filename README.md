# god level AI
A drill of scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to build stories & models. An in-depth learning resource for humans.

This is a drill for people who aim to be in the top 1% of Data and AI experts.

You can do the drill by watching video sessions or text content.

I will recommend video sessions and use text content as go-to notes.

You can be in one of the following categories
1. either you are working on a leadership position
2. or you are working as a professional
3. or you are a student

No matter what position you are working in currently, you need to put in the same amount of effort to be in the top 1%.

Spoiler alert - there are NO shortcuts in the tech field.

This is for all humans who want to get better in the field and are courageous enough to take action towards it.

You will find all the topics explained here along with whatever is needed to understand it completely.

The drill is all action-oriented.
