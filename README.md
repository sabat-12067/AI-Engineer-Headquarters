# god level AI
A drill of scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to build stories & models. An in-depth learning resource for humans.

This is a drill for people who aim to be in the top 1% of Data and AI experts.

You can do the drill by watching video sessions or text content.

I will recommend video sessions and use text content as go-to notes.

You can be in one of the following categories
1. either you are working on a leadership position
2. or you are working as a professional
3. or you are a student

Whether you are working in any of the positions currently, you need to put the same amount of effort to be in the top 1%.

Spoiler alert - there are NO shortcuts in the tech field.
