2,i bought these with a expectatio they would be great. The adjustment of the weight mechanism in order to use my 50 led super thin tv led to the tension bolt snapping. making it useless.

5,"This speaker is hefty, solid, and very rich in sound. I will not be redundant, others have written detailed reviews regarding its function. My comment is mostly about the dimensions given for this product. I do not know where they came up with 6.75 x 8.5 x 4 inches, but those numbers are way off. It measures 7.25 inches long by 3.25 inches in diameter. There are only two dimensions- not sure where they got three, it is tube shaped, after all. Perhaps JBL will listen and modify the listing.

3,"The 808 Performer is a no nonsense headphone that packs a lot of punch for its price point. The look is contemporary.  It's geared towards using with devices such as phones and tablets in that it has a built in track switch/volume control. There is also a mic for so you don't need to change headphones for making calls.<br /><br />The phones are comfortable despite not having padding on the top. The soft plastic is surprisingly comfy and the floating cans, which are closed as opposed to open, feel like they could stay put without fatigue. The company says the ear cups are padded with leather - I'm not certain it's real leather, but they are cushy and seem like they might last.  I listened to a couple of albums with these without any discomfort. They also have an innovative feature that allows you to rotate the ear cups @ a 90 degree angle, which may come in handy for phone calls. They come with a detachable cloth cable. (There is a wireless Bluetooth version for only $10 more.)<br /><br />I would describe the sound as serviceable, if underwhelming. They have a solid low end, great for bass driven music, but lack transparency and &#34;openness&#34; in the high end. Mids are decent, but because of a lack of transparency in the top end, the sound is warm, but curiously flat. The soundstage is somewhat lacking as well - let's just say it's far from deep or expansive. You can't compare these to an audiophile set of phones, nor should you: I would describe them as utilitarian, ie for listening to MP3s over a phone or tablet, they are more than up to the task.<br /><br />I tried to change tracks on my iPhone 5s and I couldn't get that to work -  I can pause tracks, but it wouldn't let me change them. As for phone calls, they seem to work well. As for the mic and how it performs, it seems adequate.<br /><br />Overall I think these are a decent set of cans for the money. As these are a closed ear headphone, they naturally cut out a certain amount of outside noise. This could be good for working in noisy environments. They are light yet rugged and sound a heck of a lot better than standard earbuds. If you're looking for a lot of features and big sound, you'd be hard pressed to do much better at this price point.be good for working in noisy environments.

1,This product should be sold with a warning that it is faulty.  After having the remote replaced the manufacture did tell me they know about the Power Button signal weakness.  The IR signal from the Flymote is so weak it requires you to stand right in front of the gbox to power down or reboot.  Many customers think that the power button does not work because it is not programed.  This is not the case since the button is programed from the factory the problem is customers expect the power button to work the same distance that all the other 2.4gh functions of the remote work at.  Also when using the keyboard the entry will studder if the mouse pointer is not turned off.  In other words in order to use the keyboard you must turn off the mouse function first.  Also using the mouse function requires a level of skill many customers may not be able to master.  Example after pointing the mouse to a app you must perform 2 key presses while holding the pointer over the app to open it. This is not easy to perform.,negative,product sold warning faulty   having remote replaced manufacture tell know power button signal weakness   ir signal fl
4,"Everything you need to listen to music or answer your phone in one small case except for power cord storage.  Maybe the next manufacturing of this product the company will make a “cord wind” on the base of the power charger and then everything will really be all in one place.<br /><br />The case is a charging station to set the two ear pieces on.  You then plug in the power cord to the case and let it charge.  It comes with an extra set of ear hooks/buds and a charging cord.<br /><br />I could get one of the ear buds to pair with my tablet/phone but I couldn’t get them to pair so I could use them as stereo.  I must need a teen/tween and I don’t have one!  Hehe  So I will just use the one ear piece.  From that, the sound is good and it stays in my ear as it is not a heavy ear bud.<br /><br />If you are looking for a no-cord, no band headset, this one will fill your requirements.

5,"I bought two to use for my pc monitors as I'm a big gamer and needed room on my desk for other stuff. This comes with all the hardware and instructions, but I did not read the instructions so I can't confirm if they are helpful or not. I did use my own drill and bit to drill 2 holes for each into the wall studs and then ratchet in the lag bolts that came with it. An earthquake could not knock these off. I'm very happy with them. I do not use the swinging ability as much as I thought I would. But no matter they do swing if needed in the future. They are stiff to move which is good and bad. Due to this I chose to stick with the lag bolts and I originally figured I would just screw to stud with wood screws, but thought pulling on the swivel over time would pull out the wood screws, just a thought.<br /><br />*Update 2/20/17<br />-still perfect, have not moved them, I use the swivel ability some, its tight and should be careful not to pull the plastic panel off the monitor, I actually grab the mount arms when I want to swivel due to this as it's so tight. But has not loosen from the wall stud at all. I can easily see it being ripped out of drywall if that's how you anchored it and DO NOT recommend that.",positive,bought use pc monitors big gamer needed room desk stuff comes hardware instructions read instructions

3,"One of the reason's I purchased this model was due to the integrated A/D conversion, as I like to convert my LP collection to 48KHz sampled audio to use on my digital media player. I tried recording the USB output into my Digital Audio Workstation using Audacity SW. All I got was seriously distorted audio, the input level set in Audacity had to be set to less than 1 (out of 10) to avoid clipping. I suspect (based on cost) that the A/D conversion is poor quality. Therefore, the USB functionality is only baggage. I like the idea of the included preamp, just to get the signal level to line level close to the cartridge and avoid noise. My Denon amp has phono preamp, but I think the TN-300 preamp is fine and should be matched to the included cartridge. Fortunately I have a good quality Firewire A/D converter, and the audio quality from the TN-300 seems completely satisfactory to me.",neutral,reason purchased model integrated d conversion like convert lp collection 48khz sampled audio use digital media player tried recording t

5,"When I first got my Sharp GX-BT9 Portable Bluetooth Boombox it had a really strong new electronics smell, but after a few weeks of using it I’m glad to report that it has gone away. I think that the unit that I received was so spanking new that it did not have time to sit in a warehouse and get a chance to air out like probably most products do.<br /><br />The GX-BT9 is the Bluetooth version of Sharp’s GX-M10. While it lacks a CD player and iPod/iPhone dock, and is a different color than the GX-M10, the GX-BT9 adds Bluetooth and Near Field Communication or NFC, making the unit more Android friendly. Apple people don’t be alarmed, it will still charge the iPhone/iPod from the unit’s front USB connector, and play through that as well if Bluetooth playback is not desired. Bluetooth playback makes the GX-BT9 more fun though since it makes your device the unit’s wireless remote letting your change the music and the volume without a tether.<br /><br />Let’s face it, Sharp’s GX-BT9 Boom Box looks like a piece of military hardware. It is big, black and heavy with a carry strap that has a carabiner on each end. If you can let that slide, then you will be happy with the sound that this thing throws at you. The GX-BT9  has 100 watts of undistorted power firing two forward facing 3 1/8 inch speakers at 17 watts per channel and two 5 1/8 inch subwoofers that rock 66 watts total power. The front speakers look bigger than they actually are since the holes they are mounted in are actually two inches larger than the speakers. This may help in sound dispersion, I don’t know. What I do know is that the front speakers provide high quality, transparent and accurate sound, while the subwoofers provide tons of room filling, though not floor shaking (which I wouldn’t expect since the lowest frequency the drivers put out is 70 Hz) bass. At times the bass can get a little bit thumpy, especially if the Extra Bass setting is turned on. Luckily, it can be turned off and that helps. When the bass gets rocking, there are blue LED’s in each of the subwoofers that light up in time to the beat, which looks really cool in a dark room. I like that the unit has two positions that it can be placed in, one is when you are listening to music nearby, while the other faces the speakers at an upward angle, which would be better for a party setting.<br /><br />Besides iPhones, iPods and Android phones the unit can also play music from a flash drive formatted in FAT16 or FAT32. It will not play music from a portable hard drive or a CD from a USB DVD/CD drive, which the unit displays the message, “NOTSUPT”. The GX-BT9 has a built in stereo FM tuner, which you initially need to use the supplied remote to tune in the stations and then save them as presets. The radio works quite well and sounds just as good as the other sources. There is also a microphone input with its own volume and echo control for those who want to sing karaoke to the music being played, as well as a guitar input for those who want to jam. There is a stereo mini-jack audio input for portable CD players, Walkmans, video equipment, and I guess whatever else you can adapt to work. Sharp really provides a lot of ways to get sound into the boom box. If you want to listen through headphones, there is a jack for that too.<br /><br />While there is a lot I like about the GX-BT9, there are a few things that I’m not so happy with. The first of those is the 8 character display, which will scroll only once to show the entire song name, then goes back to just the first 8 letters. The second is that the buttons are not backlight, and the writing telling the functions of the buttons is hard to see even when the room is not dark. I guess it’s a good thing that they provided a remote control. Thirdly, I don’t like that the boombox requires 10, yes 10 D Cell batteries, which cannot even be the rechargeable type. This adds another 3.4 pounds to an already heavy unit. I think that Sharp shouldhave provided a built in rechargeable battery with the GX-BT9. That would have made it a truly portable boombox without shelling out $30 for batteries each time you want to take it somewhere you can’t plug it in. The last thing I don’t like is the fact that the subwoofers are exposed without a grille. Since the handles for the unit are on the ends where the subs are, I have touched the speaker elements many times, and I’m afraid one day a finger might go through them. These are pretty minor gripes, but worth mentioning.<br /><br />Sharp has updated the boombox from the 80’s with the GX-BT9 with a great sounding unit that is perfect for anybody who wants loud, clear, full sounding music with lots of bass.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Looks like a piece of military hardware<br />Button functions on unit are hard to see in dark area<br />Requires 10 D size batteries – cannot use rechargeable ones<br />Display is limited to only 8 characters and only scrolls once when song loads unless remote is touched.<br />Does not have an iPhone dock or compartment to put phone in when using<br />X Bass can be a little thumpy at times – luckily it can be turned off<br />Subwoofers do not have any grilles, which may lead to possible damage<br />Heavy to carry<br /><br />Pros<br />Unit plays loudly and is extremely clear<br />Dual 5 1/8 inch subwoofers provide lots of room filling, but not floor shaking bass down to 70 Hz.<br />Built In FM Stereo Tuner<br />Versatile playback options – radio, smartphone / bluetooth, flash drive, microphone, guitar, Audio In<br />Comes with a handheld remote control<br />Dual 3 1/8 inch front speakers provide accurate high quality sound<br />Sturdy Carry Strapttery with the GX-BT9.

The salesman told me the Denon receivers are the most durable and reliable, so I decided to give it try.<br />The receiver worked fine for about 1 week, now, when the receiver is on, I get sound but no video, and when the receiver is off, i get the video but no sound from the cbl/sat hdmi port.<br />When I make a soft reset the receiver works great, but once I turn off the receiver the problem returns.<br />I live in Brazil and got this receiver during my last vacations on USA, so i can not just return it to Amazon.<br />I will never buy another Denon product.

5,"This was a great buy. This audio cable is a great length for listening to a device from your pocket or on your desk. The weave around the cable is excellent too. It is very stiff so I do find myself correcting any twists in the cable because it will form into large loops. This, along with the spring on the jack means that the cable should avoid damage very well. I expect this cable to last a long time. I listen through a DAC on my HD 598s, and I haven't noticed any sound degradation. I highly recommend getting this cable if you need to plug your headphones into a 3.5mm instead of a 1/4inch jack.

(not correct, see edit below)<br />Super tiny (see picture, it is about 2.5 quarters long by 1.5 wide) you may lose it in a bag or purse.<br />Clip will probably break before the rest of the product (it is plastic, I don't expect much).<br /><br />Overall Evaluation:<br />My list of pros is much larger than my list of cons as you can easily see.  Honestly the only con I view as a problem is the 2 volume setting thing.  It is loud enough on the Normal setting for me to use on a bus full of people, but that setting is a little loud for a quiet area for me.  I'd like to see some more fine tuning of the volume, but I'm willing to live with it because I like this product.  It is simple in its design, and its user interface was simple enough for me to try stuff like shuffle mode in an artist to find it will play just that artist (again, haven't checked the album).  This matched my needs of playing music, which it had to do and does quite well.  I like that I don't need any additional pieces or cables, and that it is not a touch screen (I hate those things).  I thought the Clip was stupid when I first got it, but now I see the use.  I clip it to my shirt when I'm walking places or riding the bus because it is easily accessible and holds well.  I think this is one of the best MP3 players you can get without getting too fancy, and would definitely recommend it to a friend.<br />5 stars given because the negative is minor and I like everything else more than enough to compensate.<br /><br />Edit: 10-12-15<br />I was wrong; there is a fine adjustment on the side of the MP3 player for the volume.

I only charge them once a week.

One thing, is that after about an hour my ears are starting to feel the pressure of them, and I want to take them off.

I had a crappy waterproof radio i bought somewhere for $10 that sounded awful and this is a HUGE improvement. We splash it lots when in the shower and it's held up just fine. Big sounds from a little speaker, I'm impressed. i just turn on my phone's pandora or spotify before getting in the shower and it works great as you can skip songs from right on the speaker. Also took it on a canoe trip and it worked well and we didn't have to worry about it getting wet. The battery seems to last a long time and charging is a breeze.

Interestingly, these can be used using Bluetooth, NFC or wired... and we checked out both Bluetooth and Wired connections with excellent results. We would recommend these to others.<br /><br />Tested with our HTC Droid DNA and its Beats Audio application and also with a Kocaso tablet, the first thing that we did was plug in the headset's micro-USB cable (included) to our Samsung USB wall charger and it took about an hour to fully charge. When trying them on, right away we noticed how comfortable these cups are on the ears. The ear cushions are firm but soft and bridge felt comfortable on our heads.<br /><br />We played all sorts of music from rock to country and.... whatever it is called that 15 year old boys listen to these days. Our music was generated from sources including Amazon's MP3 Cloud, Pandora and our own audio files, and the results were very good. These Ausdom M04 also respond very well to the equalizer applications on our devices.<br /><br />While enjoying the music, we tested the call capabilities and were impressed; the mechanics worked seamlessly and the clarity of the built-in microphone was good. The voice heard through the ear speakers makes it sound as if you are standing next to the caller, while the caller (my daughter) could hear me just fine.<br /><br />The fit, feel & function of these Ausdom M04 headphones is good, and their look is quite nice too.<br /><br />The company's retail materials note that their headphones are covered by a \\""Limited 1 year warranty, 100% Customer Satisfaction Guarantee\\"", so if an issue occurs within that period I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.<br /><br />If you are looking for headphones of this style, Bluetooth, NFC & wired playback capability, and price, for use similar to what I have described above, then my son and I would recommend giving these Ausdom M04 headphones a try based on our experience with them.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from a seller several week ago without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it.

There are some really cool apps to use with these and it's so easy to connect my Galaxy s5 and use it with these. The only problem I ran into is that I have a thick case on my phone, so it was a little difficult to get the phone to sit nicely in the glasses but it wasn't a huge inconvenience I just had to be careful with it. The regular google cardboard app gets a little boring after the first few uses but there are games and even roller coaster apps you can download to use with these. It even lets you take your own videos and watch them in virtual reality style. I laughed when I showed my husband because when we were kids, virtual realty meant standing on a platform with a big pair of goggles and lots of wires - now all it takes is cardboard and a phone.

1,"This is a waste of your money. It's cool that you can play music from your phone and the sound isn't bad, it's clean, but it's not at all impressive (and I have the SUB in addition to the Playbar and two of the Sonos1 speakers).  You can get a much better home theater system for a lot less money.  Plus, with Sonos, when it randomly stops working (&#34;player cannot be found&#34;), you get to spend an hour on hold with their call center (that has VERY limited business hours, only 6 days a week during the middle of the day) before you give up, and you can try to navigate through the myriad of self-service &#34;help&#34; on their site, send an email to them and wait more than a day for a response.  Maybe the system will come back up for you, if you're lucky they'll help you through an endless email volley, and it'll work uninterrupted that is until the next time your &#34;player cannot be found.&#34;",negative,waste money cool play music phone sound bad clean impressive sub addition playbar

We've even hooked up our Laserdisc and Blu-ray players to the amp for some great sound!! LPs, analog/digital cassettes, CDs, iPod, AM/FM all sound fantastic. Bass is above average I'd say for this size and price, tweeters good too. Vocals sound clear and instruments sound alive. I haven't noticed any distortion or off sounds. Even in an apartment, these are great. They can produce a lot of sound without sending it through the floor to your neighbor under you. We have a very large living room in our place, but even in the bedroom or small living room these would be fantastic.

5,"At this point the Brainwavz earpads are well known and well regarded in terms of comfort, quality, and sound. There are many reviews for the pleather and velour versions of these pads, which you can find here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00MFDX4YO Brainwavz HM5 Velor Memory Foam Replacements Earpads - Suitable For Many Other Branded Large Over The Ear Headphones - AKG, HifiMan, ATH, Philips, Fostex]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00MFDT894 Brainwavz Replacement Memory Foam Earpads - Suitable For Many Other Large Over The Ear Headphones - AKG, HifiMan, ATH, Philips, Fostex]]<br /><br />There was also a post about those earpads on Cnet's Audiophiliac blog. I was looking into these to use with a newly purchased pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x, which you can see here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00HVLUR86 Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Studio Monitor Headphones]]<br /><br />Basically, I was having an extremely hard time deciding between the velour and pleather options. On the one hand, pleather makes my ears sweat a lot, which is extremely uncomfortable. On the other hand, velour provides less noise isolation, and I intended to use these headphones almost exclusively on the go. Velour also reduced bass response compared to pleather. For me this was a concern, but a secondary one to comfort. I went back and fourth for a while, but eventually found this hybrid pair on Brainwavz website. They have velour where they touch your ears, and pleather on the inside (perforated) and outside. These are very similar to the earpads that Hifiman is using on their newer high end models, and they are called focus pads. In any case, these seemed like they would offer the best of both worlds for my needs, and were only slightly more expensive than the non-hybrid versions, so I bought a pair.<br /><br />I have to say, I am extremely happy I made this choice. As many others have noted, the difference in comfort is day and night. I found the stock pads on the ATH-M50x to be okay, but not very comfortable. They didn't fit completely around my ears, and they were relatively shallow, putting pressure on my head. The small pleather pads also made my ears sweat quickly. After only one day with the stock pads my Brainwavz already arrived so I switched immediately. The process of swapping the pads is not super easy, but pretty much anyone can do it with a little fiddling. With the Brainwavz on, my Audio Technica's easily became the most comfortable headphone's I own. Before the pads, they were only slightly (though still noticeably) more comfortable than my Monoprice headphones which cost less than $20.<br /><br />The Brainwavz earpads are nice and thick, and extremely soft. They really do feel like pillows on your head. The velour feels great against my skin, and the noise isolation is completely adequate for my needs. You still hear everything around you, but it's muted enough to enjoy the music. As for sound, I think most people make a slightly bigger deal about it than they need too. Yes, the sound is slightly different, but the difference is not huge. It is definitely not better or worse though, so whether you like it more or less is really up to your personal preference. As others have noted, the bass is slightly less strong. There is more room between your ears and the drivers with this pad, and the perforated pleather probably also softens it a bit. The drop in bass is only slight, and it isn't any less accurate. For me the Brainwavz pads also made the mids a little more smooth. Ultimately, YMMV. But the most important thing I can say about the sound is that you shouldn't worry too much about it (for what it's worth I don't know if the same can be said about the velour pads, I haven't tried them myself). Get these if you want to exponentially increase the comfort of your headphones.<br /><br />A short anecdote. I recently took these on a flight with me. The flight was delayed for 5 hours so we got on the plane tired from sitting in an airport. Then we found out the air conditioning on the plane wasn't working so it was extremely hot. The plane took off and I put on my Audio Technica's. (For those curious I was listening through a Fiio E17 connected to my iPhone digitally using Apple's Camera Connection Kit). After a few minutes, I was completely into my music. The pads blocked out just enough of the engine noise to let me hear my songs, and they felt great on my head. I listened for at least 2 hours straight, and despite the plane being extremely hot, and listening to my music relatively loud (to compensate for the engine noise), I was still feeling comfortable at the end. The velour kept my ears from sweating and the headphones didn't even feel stuffy! The sound quality was great and honestly, after that flight I knew 100% that I had made the right decision.<br /><br />Conclusion (TLDR):<br />These are extremely satisfying earpads that will transform the comfort level of any headphone you put them on. Additionally, if you like the feel of velour but prefer the sound/isolation of pleather, these hybrid pads are literally perfect. It's totally worth the $25 I paid and I will recommend these to all my friends.itioning on the plane wasn't working so it was extremely hot. The plane took off and I put on my Audio Technica's.

5,"This X5 Gen-II was a gift for my wife.  As soon as she lets me use it I'll update this and let you know how it compares to my X5 Gen-I sound wise.  All she's allowed me to do is load a few thousand Flac and Wav files on it so far.  Short of that it's not left her hands or ears for two solid weeks.  I'd say that's a good sign.  What I can say about the units sound is that it replaced an I Pod Classic that I bought her 10 yrs ago. ( I was sick and tired of having the same music stored in multiple formats (multiple terabytes) on the computer, and always hated how hard Apple made it on you if you just wanted to rip and transfer your own files and not have buy on I Tunes.)  She could tell the sound quality improvement right off the bat.  Even when using on crappy docking unit at work.  So did her coworkers.  As for the build, it's beautiful, like all the other Fiio products I own.  It's smaller and lighter than the Gen I, you can actually carry in jeans pocket. The GUI is all new, but like the sound, I'll have to update after she lets me actually use it.  This is the first Fiio DAP in our house that I didn't have to upgrade firmware  straight out of the box and the first that supported EXFAT well enough that I didn't have to remove partition from Micro SD (if larger than 32 gig) in order to format card in the unit  Itself.  So, it's more user friendly than past models. (I never had problems with older models and I'm no techie but some people did).  Will update more specifically after I get to actually use in depth.",positive,x5 gen ii gift wife   soon lets use update let know compares x5 gen sound wise   allowed load thousand fl

1,"We do not know who keeps writing sugar coated reviews of this company and it's products. Nobsound goes by different names on different sites. They just scream for positive feedback and reviews everywhere.  Time for a reality check.<br /><br />We bought this amp marked NS-03D after communicating with Nobsound directly.  We have had problems with their products before, TO INCLUDE empty cases and empty circuit boards on other products.<br /><br />We got the amp.  The top and face silver metal composite was absolutely permanently marked, scared, and dirty.  That's the silver colored metal you see on the top and front. Note the condition permanently.  Will not clean and you can not remove dings and marks.  Not little ones- big ones.  The volume knob was in the same wrecked condition.  This amp was sold to us as a new product..<br /><br />The VU meters do not work.  Even at almost full volume on the volume knob they barely move.  They are NOT tube biasing meters as the amp is supposed to be self-biasing. When we contacted the company and the infamous &#34;Vivian&#34; who responds for all their company and product names, we ask about the VU meters and also why they were not illuminated.  &#34;She&#34; always said they are not illuminated.  They ARE illuminated with a low sick yellow tungsten yellow light.  The meters do not work or move, but they have the little sick lighting.<br /><br />The sole 1 set of RCA input jacks on the back are made from a coated soft scag metal and scar and scratch easily. On ours &#34;new&#34; the left channel was so weak and used up it will barely hold the RCA male input, and the right channel is so tight you can BARELY get the RCA male inserted.<br /><br />Naturally the manual for tube insertion only is in full Chinese, but has one picture to show what tubes go where in English.  They also include a inkjet printed diagram in English and another language like German that shows instructions for a completely different 4 input integrated amp.<br /><br />The 5Z3P center rectifier tube barely illuminates and is notorious for being weak and poor quality (simple web search).<br /><br />Included with ours were two unmarked pirated Chinese music CDs of Asian worded music by unknown artists.<br /><br />A simple look inside the bottom plate of this amp NEVER shows the same quality components or capacitors Nobsound always shows in the photos of it's products. This amp all had the lowest end unmarked capacitors vs the better quality capacitors shown in photos.<br /><br />Asking for the schematic for this amp, like most ALL manufacturers will provide, even Yaqin, they absolutely refuse.  Take a close look at the sole photo they provide for the interior.  There is barely one slim circuit type board, and very little point-to-point wiring. This is the worst basic design with no basic circuit boards in existence.<br /><br />The ONLY thing and condition about this amp they sell good as new is at least they are not using the lower end Chinese El34 tubes.  They use the bottom end made in Russian EL34's which is 1/2 step better.<br /><br />Quality Control seems non-existent at this company by the many names they use on Amazon and other sites, and rusing customers and selling different products than shown and defective or sub stand products seems to be the norm.  They are good at marketing and lying to you via messaging.",negative,know keeps writing sugar coated reviews company products nobsound goes different names different sites scream positive feedback reviews everywh
2,"This headset is very uncomfortable to wear because the earpieces are cast at an angle and do not move, so they do not conform to your ears.  Consequently, all of the pressure is concentrated toward the front of your ears, and they become uncomfortable very quickly.  This also leaves the back of the earpieces open which causes them not to block outside sounds as well as they would if they hugged your ears better.  Finally, the pair that I received will not hold a charge, but I assume that all of these headsets do not suffer from that problem.

I tested everything before running the wire and then enclosed the ends in tape / foam before pulling the cable through the walls and hand routing the cable through the ceiling for protection. Even so, after I ran the cable the cable prong snapped off as soon as I plugged it into my TV. I immediately requested a replacement and had no issues with the second one.

5,"I got this from the Vine program because I had developed a set of phones and chargers around a particular spot, and I needed more plugs even though I wasn't pulling much electricity.  Stuff like cordless phone stations, cell phones, tablets, don't draw much, but need a permanent plug.<br /><br />I was particularly delighted that this strip, unlike many I own, has the plug holes precisely sized.  The plugs go in and come out easily, but don't fall out.  There's no gap leaving the plug prongs visible.  And each plug has a ground.  The cord that plugs into the wall is thick, sturdy, solidly welded to the strip and its wall plug.  The wall plug goes into the wall smoothly, completely, securely.  It won't fall out, but it is not so tight you can't get it all the way in.<br /><br />On the back of the strip there are standard indented holes so you can hang this strip on screws on the wall.  This design has one big space for a chunky transformer type plug, and I could wish all the plugs were spaced like that.  Note, it also has a rocker switch that lights up red when the power is on.  You can turn off the appliances with that switch.  When the light blinks, replace the strip because the surge protection is failing.<br /><br />This surge-protector strip is fairly standard, not heavy duty, has no &#34;backup power supply&#34; -- but this is the sort of item you need almost all your small devices, chargers, phones, etc. plugged into unless you have a surge protector on your home's power-entry point.<br /><br />Here is what it looks like with several transformer lumps plugged in.  After hanging on a wall or baseboard and neatening up the wires, this surge protector will serve you well for years.",positive,got vine program developed set phones chargers particular spot needed plugs pulling electricity   stuff like cordl

4,"Free product provided for evaluation and review.<br /><br />This has 6 outlets for US households.  Each one is capable of holding a 2 or 3 prong plug.  It plugs into a 3 prong outlet itself.  It has a power switch for on/off.  I have found this to be particularly useful in my kitchen for plugging up small appliances that aren't used that often.  Instead of having to reach back behind everything to plug or unplug stuff, I just leave everything plugged into this strip and flip the power on as I need something.<br /><br />It has performed flawlessly, and I think is a good price.  The only downside really is that it does not come with any independant insurance for surge suppression as some products do.  That insurance is not the easiest sort to file a claim on, but I have seen it done, and it came in handy to someone living in an apartment without other insurance.<br /><br />The power cord is 1.5 meters, which is just a bit short  of 5 feet (It's 4.9 feet long).",positive,free product provided evaluation review.<br /><br />this 6 outlets households   capable holding 2 3 prong plug   plugs 3 prong outlet

In the case of these headphones, which are presently pretty much dirt cheap in terms of cost, the audio is really quite good. Naturally, the quality of the audio from your source device will play a big part of the sound you hear. Scratchy recordings from old LPs or the highly compressed Mp3 downloads will certainly bring down the quality of the music you are listening to, but that is not the headphones fault.

5,"Great bundle of stuff with a better than average receiver.  The new Sony does just about everything I wanted in a new receiver.  It is fully HDMI (no component hookup, however so some of the older stuff still has to connect directly to the TV).  The &#34;SongPal&#34; app works quite well on my iPhone and I can control the speakers, sources, volume, sound field settings, etc. from my phone. That was the primary reason I bought this one.  Along the way I also found that it has both bluetooth receive and transmit.  The transmit means I can use bluetooth wireless headphones and when I select bluetooth transmit it shuts off the wired speakers and connects via wireless to the headphones.  The only problem with the bluetooth transmit to headphones is that sometimes the voices and video get out of sync.  Just have to turn off the bluetooth transmit and turn it back on (sometimes a few times) to get the video and sound back in sync.  The wired speakers work great and can be set up in a 5.1 A and 2 channel B speaker configuration or in a 7.1 or 7.2 configuration.  I'm running 5.1 on the A and stereo on the B (outdoor) speakers and the configuration works very well.  This is a good value receiver for all you get for the price.

We live 23 miles from the nearest antenna farm (Houston market) but have lots of problems getting PBS and CBS to come in consistently.  I hooked up this antenna and temporarily attached it to the wall near the TV to test it...got PBS but could not bring in CBS.  So I propped it up on top of our TV cabinet, rotated it away from the wall and also tipped it at an angle...boom...CBS was coming in.  After a few weeks PBS is extremely spotty although nothing in our setup had changed or moved.  Just now spent some time moving it around again and currently it is bringing in all the stations.

5,"I first saw these fans and thought &#34;great - this is just what I need to cool my A/V Cabinet!&#34; but being half a world away I wanted to make sure these were the right thing to get. So I fired an email off to AC Infinity, only half expecting a reply, as it is so common to get very little response from companies. However AC Infinity were brilliant, even though I was planning on spending less than $100, every email I sent was rapidly replied to with detailed information - including photos (I was wanting to know if the power supply supported 240V - it does). So no faults on pre purchase delivery.<br /><br />Secondly I had read that at low speeds there was fan noise, which made me nervous about buying. Again AC Infinity were straight up that their old stock had an issue, but they had revised the fan controller, and the new ones were ok - but they suggested waiting 2 months until the new stock was at Amazon.<br /><br />So I duly purchased and Amazon dispatched to New Zealand, where they stayed in the box for a few months (moving house etc) I finally unboxed them, and was impressed with the finish and build quality - they are beautifully made units. Alas once I installed them I noticed they had the dreaded low speed rattle.<br /><br />I let AC Infinity know, not expecting to much. But again I was delighted at their prompt response, requesting a bit more information which allowed them to confirm the units I had received from Amazon were old stock. Unprompted, they offered to send me some new units at no cost (not even the postage to New Zealand) which arrived in only a matter of days. These units were installed, and they work brilliantly. Quiet, and very effective at moving air and dropping cabinet temperatures.<br /><br />I cannot recommend these units and AC Infinity enough, the units are excellent and the customer service even more so. Would buy again without hesitation.<br /><br />Thanks AC Infinity!",positive,saw fans thought 34;great need cool v cabinet!&#34 half world away wanted sure right thing fired

5,"With the rising costs of just about everything lately, we decided to drop our Direct-TV and purchase an antenna for our roof. After some research I had it narrowed down to 2.<br />A few weeks ago I purchased the 1byone OUS00-0557 Digital Outdoor HDTV Antenna with Mounting Pole for UHF/VHF/FM Radio.<br />After a few weeks of &#34;warbled&#34; tv, I'd had enough and I ordered the RCA antenna, and I love it! I live pretty close to my favorite<br />tv stations,(all within 30 miles)  so I knew that I would pick them up without a problem and be able to watch them (unlike the 1byone) It seems very sturdy and installation was pretty straight forward. I'm getting my network stations, crystal clear!

5,"Great product.  I guess I don't have large ears so the issue of small earcups that seems to come up in these reviews is not an issue.  I have sat down for several hour binge watching Netflix sessions and fallen asleep watching and have experienced no discomfort with extended use.  I listen to a lot of americana, folk, and indie music and the quality of these headphones shines through with these genres of music that don't emphasize robust base and low end.  Also the noise isolation of these headphones is better than expected.  I did a lot of research before purchasing on headphones in the 200-350 dollar range.  When the price of these dropped with the release of the momentum 2.0 I jumped on them.  Would have been just as happy paying full retail as I feel they are worth the investment for someone looking for high end over the ear headphones.",positive,great product   guess large ears issue small earcups come reviews issue   sat hour binge watching netflix sessions

The sound is very nice and is easy to hook up to your devices. The only thing that could be added to this speaker is a way of turning the volume up or down directly from the speaker. The only way to change the volume is from the device it is hooked up to, but it's not that big of a deal, it just might inconvenience some users.

Firstly, the tuner is crappy-- stiff to turn, poor lock in of stations, if you turn off the radio when listening to a weaker station, it drifts off of the station selected!!<br />I tried one of my older KA 500 radio next to the new one, and it has signicant background hiss, and poor<br />Clarity! This new radio will not pull in the remote stations that the other radios get with no problem...<br />So, this can not be a good choice for emergency or even regular use!",negative,good purchase 4th ka 500 quality radio gone downhill regards performance firstly tuner crappy-- stiff turn poor lock

After I got one, 3 of my friends wanted one, and they all love them, I don't understand the picture, these are NOT in any way waterproof, and the statement that multiple copies can link to create wonderful sound is, so far, proving untrue. I can connect two via Bluetooth at the same time, but sound still only comes out of one.There is no manual included, and I followed the steps mentioned in the answers to get one, but haven't heard anything. Still, the sound is that good that I still rate it 4 stars.

The fold mechanism seems to be solid but doesn't give a comforting &#34;click&#34; when tested, a little &#34;plasticky &#34; if that makes sense.  microphone quality was excellent and button seems solid, something that didn't last 6 mo. with the Fanny Wangs.  I have only listened to podcasts so I can't speak to the bass but I have noticed that these do allow a lot of outside noise through.  I walk to work along a busy street and like to listen to music when vaccumming and I don't believe that I will be able to keep a sensible volumn and still have clarity with these in those situations.  That said I am looking forward to now having nearly as much &#34;hot-ear&#34; when wearing them for long periods of time.<br />Overall great deal for the price and design.",positive,purchased replace pair fanny wang showing age   happy price comfort softer cups headband   fold mechanism solid

4,"It's pretty decent for a budget earphone but there are some caveats associated:<br /><br />Look/Feel:<br />The earphones do not look as premium as they look in the pictures but I guess it's understandable for the price. The flat cables are pretty good in avoiding tangles but will crease pretty easily. The earbuds are a wee bit small to the hold as compared to other earphones that I have. There is a rubbery matte finish all over the wire as well as the earbuds. I purchased the white ones and in my opinion it's average looking.<br /><br />Sound:<br />This has ample amount of bass to it. I was not expecting to have this much but I was surprised. The highs are good but the lows are a bit troublesome at times. The bass can become a little too much beyond 50% volume and overall the sound gets slightly muffled as compared to the Symphony NRG that I have which does not have as much bass as this one does. It suffers from minor noise/distortion at higher volumes for standard Apple AIFF files or normal WAV files, but then again you won't listen to songs in such high volumes (or atleast you shouldn't). Overall the sound quality is above average and pleasing to the ears.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />The earbuds are pretty comfortable and it comes with some additional ear pads in case you want to adjust to fit according to your needs. Options are limited though. The ear buds snug fit properly and has pretty good noise isolation.<br /><br />Overall, this is pretty good if you are looking for a mid range earphone in a budget, if you are an audiophile who does not want abundance of bass in their headphones then look elsewhere.",positive,pretty decent budget earphone caveats associated:<br /><br />look feel:<br />the earphones look premium look pictures guess understand

Whether it's on vacation, to work or just to play at my house.<br /><br />Well that led me to this great TaoTronics wireless speaker.  Now if you've read some of my other Amazon reviews, you will know that I have done a lot of business with TaoTronics in the past.  So when I needed a bluetooth speaker that was easily compatible, well I went directly to TaoTronics because their products are always top of the line, at a fraction of the price of the other &#34;Big Boy&#34;companies out there.<br /><br />This speaker delivered on what TaoTronics said and MORE!  I've been using it mainly at my office for the last week or so and it's awesome.  Where I work, I have two offices.  By having this portable speaker with me, I can now easily pick it up and take it between my offices with no problems.  In fact, I've gotten a lot of great comments on how good it sounds, yet being so small.<br /><br />Here are some other reasons why you should buy this product from TaoTronics:<br />*It's Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker compatible with most smartphones and Bluetooth electronics so you can use it everywhere<br />*It's built with intuitive lights: The speaker lights look awesome when on and they communicate during the pairing<br />*This speaker lasts long: It will last, on one charge, for 6 hours of play and talk time so you can enjoy music all the time<br />*You can also do Hands-free calling with the built-in microphone<br />*Plus, it comes with a 12 month warranty and a 30 day money back guarantee (but trust me you won't be returning it once you receive it!!!)<br /><br />This is a must buy for anyone looking for an all in one awesome Bluetooth speaker!ker!",positive,bluetooth speaker < br /><br />i purchased bluetooth speakers taotronics wireless speaker portable speaker bluetooth 4.0 high fidelity audio built microphone led light a2dp profiling 6

5,"[[VIDEOID:aafe5abf417d4bbf9119297a370fef09]] I own a lot of Bluetooth speakers. Some of them are cheap and some more expensive, but they all seemed to sound about the same! I saw this speaker at Best Buy for $60, and price checked with amazon for about $30. For 30 dollars I wasn't expecting much, I was expecting the run of the mill speaker that sounds like every other Bluetooth speaker out there. But when I played it for the first time I was truly amazed at how much sound that speaker put out, and the quality of the sound! I truly love this speaker, and will continue to buy HMDX products from now on.<br /><br />PROS:<br /> - This speaker is LOUD! It will fill an entire room with sound at half volume, and at full volume you'll have to turn it down!<br /> - This speaker can be paired with another Jam Plus. Please see the end of this review for instructions on how to pair the speakers.<br /> - The Jam Plus is water resistant, I have used it near my pool multiple times and I'm sure it's been splashed. The speaker still works fantastically!<br /> - It has built in buttons to control your music. The buttons include &#34;Play/Pause&#34;, &#34;Volume Up&#34; and &#34;Volume Down&#34;.<br /> - This speaker is very durable. I've dropped it and the worst that has happened is a small chip in the side of the speaker. The speaker still works well though!<br /> - Will work with any Bluetooth compatible device.<br /> - This speaker actually has a built in microphone that's used to take calls if you're speaker is paired to your phone.<br /><br />CONS:<br /> - The loud voice prompts can get annoying, and there doesn't seem like there is a way to disable them!<br /> - By itself the speaker only plays in Mono, but it doesn't seem to degrade the quality much.<br /> - The battery in this speaker doesn't last very long, and has to be recharged often.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Overall I'd recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a affordable, good sounding, and loud speaker. I still can't believe this speaker is only $30 because it sounds better than my other $50 speaker!<br /><br />PAIRING INSTRUCTIONS:<br />First look on the bottom of each speaker and move the switch on one speaker to &#34;L&#34; and one to &#34;R&#34;.

4,"I just got these today. So far, the $30 I spent for them is $30 very well spent. The sound is great and very clear with some awesome bass. I was a little disappointed they weren't as dark as they looked in the picture, but the sound more than makes up for it. I have seen some that have issues with the band breaking, so I will keep an eye out for that and update this if it occurs any time soon. But out of the box, an easy pairing, the sound is great, and they are comfortable on my ears with my glasses on.  March 27, 2016 UPDATE: I've had these for a while now and still have had no issues. The sound is still amazing, they are still comfortable, and stay in place when I am at the gym using them.

5,"I bought one of these from the KickStarter project, and I absolutely love it.  No extra frills, no bells and whistles, just music the way it was meant to be heard.  I use my Pono Player with a pair of Sennheiser HD600 headphones and a balanced audio cable I bought from Custom Cans in UK.  I've never heard music sound better than when I listen to my Pono, the difference is amazing (and much cheaper than an audiophile quality Home Audio system).  The touch screen can be a bit sensitive at times, but not enough to be aggravating.  The USB 2 connection can be a bit slow when transferring a large number of songs, but this shouldn't be too noticeable after your initial music transfer.  Except for a couple of very minor drawbacks, I think this is by far the best portable music player for the money.  You can get portable players that sound better, but you'll have to pay around $1,000 to do it.  Unless your willing to shell out another $600 or more for a tiny increase in quality, then the Pono is the player to get.",positive,bought kickstarter project absolutely love   extra frills bells whistles music way meant heard   use pono player pair

5,"Some would wonder - why get this when you have ear buds that are portable also. There are a few reasons I prefer this device to earbuds. First of all, how many times have you been working around the house and gotten the cord hung up and the buds get snatched out of your ears? Or worse, the phone gets snatched out of your hand and goes flying? Okay, maybe I'm just a moron.<br />Another advantage is that you can still hear sounds around you. I use this speaker when I'm working around the house while listening to books or podcasts. With earbuds, my family has to wave me down to get my attention. Not with this device. I can hear the doorbell or other stuff while listening.<br />As for how it stacks up to other portable devices - I would say it's solid. The price is reasonable, the size is small enough to fit in a book bag, but still gives a nice full sound. And it really is simple to set up and use.<br />If you are looking for premium sound this isn't it. But if you want to have a nice, portable option to earbuds, I think you'll be happy with this wireless speaker.",positive,wonder ear buds portable reasons prefer device earbuds times working h
2,"The product is well made an appears to be strong enough for daily use. The problem I had with it is that I found it to be very uncomfortable to wear for more than 1/2 hour. It also made my ears very warm. I understand that other reviewers said that the headphones were comfortable. So it may be a personal opinion and there's no way to know ahead of time without trying them on first. For what it's worth, after testing these headphones I went to Target to determine if the lack of comfort and the warm ears was something that I would experience with all headphones. In fact it isn't. I tried some of the demo's that Target has on display and they were much more comfortable. Of course the price was 6 to 10 times the price for the Amazon Basic. I hope this helps you. I did find that the sound was quiet good and room ambient noise was reduced substantially.

Lightweight, clear sound, stayed put during vigorous activity.  Pretty much everything the packaging says.  It has decent battery life.  One complaint is that the on-device controls don't always play nice with my android device, but that's more likely to be an issue with my phone which has had problems with several Bluetooth headsets in the past.  Everything was going well for the first three months, then the left bud stopped working.<br /><br />Why does this review still have 4 stars, then?<br /><br />Because BlueAnt customer service was awesome.  Without any hassle, they sent me a completely new-in-the-package set as a replacement.  The only thing that keeps this from being a five-star review is the fact that originals shorted out in the first place (obviously) and the fact that the new ones took a few weeks to ship to me.

I can recommend this for the small, echo-y confines of the bathroom, prof it's right next to you out doors, but this isn't going to project sound at a party. Compared to what's available at your local big box retailer, this has good function and range at a great price. If you want to spend $100, you'll get better performance.  Since the company that makes this sent this to me free of charge, and I'm swimming in Bluetooth speakers, I took this one apart. It's got a nice-sized battery (I got 4 hours of top volume in a rented U-Haul last weekend) and a couple of smallish but heavy long-stroke speakers.  Everything seems to be well thought out, even the packaging is pretty nice. The girl that announces the status of the Bluetooth connection is charmingly Chineese, and range is a pretty typical 30 feet.

4,"I purchased 2 of these used from a popular auction site for $60 each.  They are very easy to hook up and configure.  I connected an outdoor tv antenna and one of these modulators in my basement to a two port splitter/combiner, then I used an 8 way splitter to send Charter cable + all the free over the air HD channels to every tv in my house.  It saves us the cost of renting a cable box for all the other tv sets.  I plan on using the second box upstairs in the living room to insert the blue ray player and a probably a roku on channels 20 & 22.  We use the Next Generation remote control extender to control the Charter cable box from any room in the house to change the cable channel. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C1Z0HA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage<br /><br />Worth Noting:<br />1)  Using cheap video cables produces a very bad picture on your tv sets.  I made my own video cables cut to the shortest possible lengths using RG6/U cable and compression RCA connectors and it provides a very good picture to all the tv sets.<br />2) The video going to the tv is only 480p and doesn't fill the entire screen of my 1080p tv.

5,"Recently used this product on a tubing trip, and it worked very well.  I would highly recommend.  It's bigger than I had anticipated, but that's a good thing so it has a little bit extra space for large smartphones to fit along with maybe a car key or extra batteries.  I also really like the aux cable, so your phone doesn't get drained using Bluetooth, and you can also use it with non-Bluetooth devices like my ipod shuffle.<br /><br />The other thing I didn't realize until I tested it, is the speaker also floats quite well in water.  It's a little heavy, but bobs just fine on the surface of the water even with a phone inside.  The two clips closures on the side are very strong and have a button latch sort of release system, so it's a little more trustworthy not to just pop open in water.  I also liked the small strap and carabineer that came with - it clipped perfectly to a small handle on the outside of my cooler and hung there within easy reach.  It has a nice mesh pocket on the inside too, so when you open it up, your phone stays secure in the pocket and doesn't just fall out.<br /><br />The audio quality and volume is pretty good for what you'd expect in this type of product.  It's not as amazing as a really expensive Bluetooth speaker for people who might be bothered by that, but that's kind of like comparing apples and oranges.  For sitting outside on a lake/river or in a normal size boat and listening to party music, I was very happy with the quality and volume.  But, if you want something that is really going to project the music across a large outdoor space or be louder, you might want to look at the boom box model offered by the same company instead.",positive,recently product tubing trip worked   highly recommend   bigger anticipated good thing little bit extra space lar

My only issue is that the ear cushions/tips fall off really easily. I lost my first pair of silicone cushions within a week of use. Since the others in the pack don't fit me very well, I pulled a pair off of some old earphones. They seem to stick better, but the cushions sometimes get stuck in my ears when I try to take out the earbuds (and become disconnected). You just have to be really careful with them.

They don't block *quite* as much airplane noise as over-the-ear headphones, but they block a lot. I really appreciate the fact that you can still hear music through them even if they are off or have run out of power. That's not true of all noise-cancellers. Sound is great and well-balanced on these too. They pouch keeps them protected and slips into whatever you're carrying as you travel. While they of course don't block varying noises like voices, etc., I find that if I'm playing music through them, they dampen other sounds enough that they don't bother me.

5,"(free sample supplied for review purposes)  Consider my rating 4 1/2 stars.  The first thing I want to address is the charging problem some have and it has to do with one thing, it uses USB which requires it to be charged from a computer(trickle charge) and some outlet chargers. Some have mentioned that with this version and others they are only able to get about a half an hour to an hour worth of play time. If you charge it from a computer you will get 6 to 7 hours or more depending on what you are using it for.  I really like the dark red metallic color, it is not just cool looking it is also easy to spot when you set it down.  This unit has the 32 GB built in, there are other versions that have a micro SD card slot that come with a 16 GB SD card. So depending how much you want to do with it you will have to decide what is best for you but 32 GB internal storage is a lot and will be enough for most.  Let's start with the packaging and honestly this might be my biggest negative but really didn't effect my rating. It comes in a two part clear plastic case wrapped in glued on cellophane. Don't try to remove the cellophane, take a knife and slice along the sides where the two pieces of plastic come together, slice along the two long sides and the bottom short side, you will feel your knife slightly enter the slot along the sides. By leaving the top side connected you will have a flip open case.  The player itself fits my needs perfectly, mostly for walking and listening to music and audio books. I got over 4 hours of playing time using it for that and probably had more but decided to charge the player, I don't like to let the battery get to low. The player does so much more than play audio files, there are even 4 games included but watching video and playing games might not be the best things to use the player for because of the small screen size but you can, pictures and video quality were very good. You can also record what you are listening to on the radio to or use it as a voice recorder. The radio worked great and the reception was surprisingly good. My only real negative was the bass with the supplied ear buds was not very good even at the rock setting on the equalizer but I rarely get good bass out of ear buds, the bass was a lot better with an over the ear pair of headphones.  The player was very intuitive, I never did look at the instructions and only encountered a few minor bumps in the road that I eventually figured out. The interface has a quaint old school pixelated look but really was a non issue for me. For my needs it was perfect and is very highly recommended for those with similar needs to mine.",positive,free sample supplied review purposes   consider rating 4 1/2 stars   thing want address charging problem thing uses usb requ

1,"This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  DO NOT EVEN TRY THIS!  You can only listen effectively by headphones, but do NOT put the headphone on your ears or you may honestly & severely damage your eardrums.  I purchased this to help find what might be a mouse or bird in a wall, but the feedback on this was potentially physically damaging from the moment I turned it on to every time I tried to adjust the volume dial , even just to turn it on & have it at its lowest volume.  I had to seriously be concerned that I had ear damage & I got a massive headache within one minute.  Still have the ear pain & headache right now, four hours later.  I couldn't stop, reduce, or eliminate this from happening.  Also, the movement of your fingers holding the device is heard through the headphones, as well as the contact made by the object on the wall.  Whether it's touching something or you're touching it there is loud feedback through the headphones, too much to hear anything.  I tried to listen to known noise in the next room & couldn't hear anything but very loud static, and suddenly it hits you that no matter what you're trying to listen for it's not worth losing your hearing over.  As others have said, it looks cheap.  The silver part that touches the wall was already bent when I opened the box & looked like it could fall off easily.  Don't risk your hearing, & do not let children go anywhere near this.  And this is coming from someone that has been to quite a few very loud rock concerts.

5,"I bought this unit because it was the size, style and price I was looking for.  There were no reviews, but I took a flier on it because I read the reviews of other Mounting Dream wall mounts and they were very favorable.  I would have to say I am extremely satisfied with this mount.  I'm using it to mount a Sharp 42&#34; LCD TV.  It went up very easily and quickly.  The instructions were accurate and easy to follow (I have done this several times before so I'm not a novice).  The box came with hardware for mounting to studs or masonry.  It also had hardware for flat screens or curved back TV's.  I had no problems getting the TV mounted and up on the rails.  The fit and finish is excellent.  It is sturdy and holds the TV in place nicely.  The left or right motion doesn't lock, but it doesn't move by itself.  I find it to be balanced very nicely and moving the TV around doesn't take too much effort and it stays where I leave it.  You must have 16&#34; apart studs to use this mount.  Anything up or down will not work.  The only concern I had was hanging the TV on the mount.  The hole pattern on my TV was just about as wide as the mount. I didn't have more than 1/8&#34; on either side to spare.  But it does have a lock screw on each vertical rail so it stays secure.  Bottom line...this is a very good unit and I'm very satisfied with it.  I would definitely purchase a Mounting Dream wall mount for my next project.",positive,bought unit size style price looking   reviews took flier read reviews mounting dream wall mounts

5,"I'll give this 5 stars with the caveat that you are getting exactly what you pay for on a sub $20 small form factor Bluetooth earpiece. The battery life is surprisingly excellent, the sound quality is decent, and the size of the adapter is small. The coolest part about this earpiece is the fact that it comes with a mini-USB second earphone that plugs into the earpiece to create completely wireless headphones. It is very cool and I used it at the gym without either of them falling out.<br /><br />The unit comes with a ton of extra earpiece adapters to fit pretty much everyone and loops to keep the earpiece attachd if you can't get them to sit properly. It also comes with a small charging cable, but no wall-plug adapter (not a big deal - charge it on your computer or one of your cell phone chargers). The small clam-shell holder case is nifty and holds everything shipped. Nice little bonus for sure.<br /><br />I've been using it consistently for a while now and have charged it twice from completely drained. It charged fully in about 20-30 min and lasts a good 6+ straight hours of use, days on standby if you aren't using it for music. It does have a real time battery meter it will display on your phones home screen. I found it very accurate in indicating where the adapter was in regards to it's battery life.<br /><br />No one has had any questions or made any comments as to not being able to hear me or anything when on it, so I assume they cannot tell I am on a headset. I can't say the same for my $200 Plantations headset my work bought me, so a $15 adapter wins there, big time!<br /><br />My only nit here is the branding on the device, the huge black lettering (or white lettering on the black version) is ugly. I would have gone with a lower profile logo or something, it just makes it look cheap. Just my $0.02 there :-)<br /><br />All in all 5/5 stars. I would highly recommend if you need a cheap Bluetooth earpiece!",positive,5 stars caveat getting exactly pay sub $ 20 small form factor bluetooth earpiece battery life surprisingly excellent sound quality

I use my SONY for all sounds and the Global volume setting works perfectly. I had all the same functions with my TW remote without the TW price.

She has favorite stations so digital tuning and reception are very important. One of her favorite stations in the Boston area often had reception issues with her old radio in our suburb 20 miles from the tower. This radio pulls it in in Boothbay 150 miles away. No other radio she has tried including the car radio does anything like that. The other thing that she likes is the sound - very good for a portable radio. The option to use replaceable batteries or rechargeables is also a nice feature. To illustrate how much we like it I bought her a second one to keep in Boothbay so she doesn't have to pack it.,positive,bought radio wife listens radio day inside outside boston suburbs boothbay maine favorite stations digital tuning reception ar

If you have not read my other posts I am downsizing my life to move into an RV.  Needless to say this fits my application perfectly.<br /><br />As I said I have it hooked up to my record player and then to some Niles OS 5.5 speakers (8 OHM 5- 100W Speakers).  It sounds great period.  I know some reviews mention distortion when on max, well I can honestly say I have not heard any.<br /><br />With that said my only complaint is the power, but I have it hooked up in a large open living room (living room, dining room, and kitchen are all one open area) area so I am sure in a smaller room there would be no issue.<br /><br />That said I will try to post back in a month are so with an update.

Do not purchase this item as it has been a problem from the start.  ****The first unit I received didn't function properly. I contacted customer support and after a few e-mails I was issued a replacement. The new unit seems to function properly. One complaint I have is that the suction cup is worthless.

So for $20 the sound quality is good.<br /><br />Con: Receiver/mic section is larger that your normal mic section because the battery is located in the steam section, so I found that the earpiece tends to slip out while running. This same section is also closer to the cheek than the jaw or chin.  Another flaw that I don't like is the ear buds. For some reason they are very uncomfortable. I've never had problems with other ear buds slipping out or being uncomfortable but these hurt my hears.<br /><br />I will still keep for $20.

4,"While I haven't had it very long, I'm generally pleased so far with this headset. It paired easily with my iPhone 5S and delivers good sound. The earbuds fit well, seem to be secure (although I haven't given them much of a challenge), and were comfortable. They even fit well under a motorcycle helmet, although enough ambient noise (wind, etc.) got through that I wonder how well I would have been able to hear any phone calls or music, and I'm skeptical that anyone on the other end of a phone call would have been able to hear me. This isn't my primary intended use for them so it doesn't matter much to me that they probably won't serve for a motorcycle hands-free phone option, but a buyer seeking that functionality had probably better keep looking. My only significant disappointment is related to customer service. Several days ago I contacted the customer support folks for this product asking for a PDF or other digital copy of the user's manual, and have not received a reply or even an acknowledgement of my request.",positive,long generally pleased far headset paired easily iphone 5s delivers good sound earbuds fit secure haven

4,"This is a nice pair of headphones.<br /><br />It is so nice to have a pair of headphones that pair over Bluetooth and if you choose, NFC in cooperation with Bluetooth.  I initially chose to pair my Android phone (Nexus 6) over NFC.  It requires both Bluetooth and NFC to be turned on.  I also paired these headphones over Bluetooth to my iPad. (The NFC chip is in the right ear of the headphones).  Both were very simple to do, but I found myself relying on the indicator light to know if pairing occurred when using NFC because I was holding the phone and the headphones together to pair in front of me  and could not hear the audio prompts occurring in the headphones (NFC pairs by touching the devices together).<br /><br />Regarding sound quality, I am not an audiophile, so if it sounds good to me, it sounds good.  The sound that comes out of these headphones is super crisp in my opinion.  To me, these seem to be lacking in the bass department, but mids and highs are good.  I  listened to some rock, rap, and movie soundtracks during my initial testing.<br /><br />I like the small size of these and they are comfortable.  A carrying case is included with a wire if Bluetooth and/or NFC/Bluetooth are not options for you.<br /><br />There is one big (at least to me) problem with these that I need to point out.  The sound, at my normal listening level...which may be a bit high, leaks out of these headphones and the people surrounding you can hear what you are listening to. My wife pointed this out to me as I was testing (listening) to various kinds of music.  She could tell me what song I was listening to.  I am usually an earbuds kind of person, and this is not a problem with my earbuds. This may be a problem with headphones of this shape in general and I will have to go back and test other headphones to be sure if other products have this issue.<br /><br />Overall, these are very nice.  Just be sure not to listen too loud.",positive,nice pair headphones.<br /><br />it nice pair headphones pair bluetooth choose nfc cooperation bluetooth   initially chose pair

I am sure there are newer, better versions now than there were when I purchased this device, but at the time, as I did not have a smartphone, and I simply wanted a good mp3 player, the Ipod touch was a great little gadget to buy.

The sound quality is great, and I love that it can play 45s, 33s, and 78s.  It would be nice to have an automatic player for the convenience factor, but then you're looking at spending much more.

5,"Bottom Line:  Big sound, great feel, can not find a better set of headphones out there.<br /><br />This is my 4th set of headphones from Bluedio.  I have owned R and R+ before so I was very excited to try this new release.  UFO does what the previous versions didn't - using a similar headphone as the R, they really turned up the look and feel of quality.  The unpackaging experience was better than any before, and the look of the headphone is boss - The UFO mark makes it look like a boxer - beating up the competition in appearance.  Definitely something you'd wear if you were bulking up at the gym, not small enough something you'd want to wear jogging.  The additional banding around the adjustable parts really improved what was weak before - it is very sturdy.<br /><br />Compared to the previous generation, it is a little heavier but more comfortable around the ears, it blocks even more ambient sound than before - you can very easily be in your own world with these headphones and no one can hear you.<br /><br />As with all Bluedio, these headphones simply embarass other products with huge marketing spend, like Beats by Dre.  I tried them at wal-mart and just don't understand how they are in business when products like Bluedio are so much better.  The power charging cycle is fast, and they last days of standby + playing music.  The bluetooth signal goes very far, through many walls, at least 200+ feet.<br /><br />Compared to R+, they removed the SD card feature and made a more minimalist look.  However, they also removed the built-in equalizer which is needed to appreciate the maximum potential of the headphones.  I had to download a EQ app for android to get the full potential.  Like other Bluedio headphones, using the headset for phone conversations sucks because the sound is so big that is gets into the Mic, and people can hear feedback on the other end of the line - or it is dampened and they can not hear you talk.  Not important but would be nice if it was improved.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a great pair of headphones, start with R+, but if you have the extra dollars to spare, the nicer look and durability are worth some extra spend for those power users who will use this head set all the time.",positive,line   big sound great feel find better set headphones there.<br /><br />this 4th set headphones bluedio   owned r r+ excited

Best of all, it had a dimming function for the clock. This would have been a five-star review, but now, 5 months later, it rarely works. The buttons do not respond. I used to be able to unplug it and replug it in and the buttons would work for a while, though I had to set the clock myself because the sync function failed. Now that does not seem to be working so I can't use any function but the chargers and the clock, which is stuck on its brightest setting.

4,"Before deciding to buy the Anker A7908 I looked at several other speakers of the same price point, as well as read some reviews, All of which praised the high sound quality, extra long 20 hour battery life and built-in microphone for answering calls, and said this is the best portable bluetooth speaker under 50$, period.<br />Overall, I'm happy with having the Anker. It plays music great and lasts forever. Not everything is perfect, however.<br /><br />First of all, the pros.<br />- The battery life is amazing. I charged the speaker for the very first time after at least 2 weeks of moderate, daily usage. I did not charge it fully after unboxing it. This is the longest lasting electronic device I ever had, as far as I can remember, and I’m not concerned about turning it off even if I’m not listening to music.<br />- The sound quality is satisfying for the price and size. When comparing it to my Creative T15 Wireless it sounds a bit distorted and empty, but consider this – each of the Creative speakers’ subwoofer is about the size of the Anker’s one driver, and they has an additional tweeter and lots of space inside them, so the comparison isn’t very fair. Put it side by side with a Beats Pill and the difference is night and day. The Anker’s base is much more present, the mid and treble is accurate and the sound is rich. I guess it’s just a matter of perspective.<br /><br />Now, the cons. (Most of which are really small and might not even matter to everyone)<br />- The speaker isn’t very loud. It fills a quiet large room easily, but with background noises such as several conversations or a hot-tub, it needs to be cranked up to the max volume, which distorts the sound a bit. But again, it is very small. When sitting outside the sound can’t bounce back from the walls, and the direction of the driver, which faces straight up, becomes a weakness. Consider a larger speaker of you plan to use it in parties of more than a few people.<br />- The microphone is incredibly weakand does not capture voice well. I tried it with Siri and several regular phone calls and I wasn’t being heard in either cases, unless I talked loudly directly into the mic. I don’t use this function much, so it’s not too bad.<br />- When turned on, the speaker connects automatically to the last device it was connected to, but if it can’t find it the light flashes and it beeps every 10 seconds or so. It’s pretty annoying and definitely unnecessary.<br />- The volume buttons are independent of the device volume. I’d rather them to control the volume of the device, so I’d have just one volume meter to control.<br />- The middle button can be used to pause and play music, as well as answering phone calls and activating Siri, but for some reason not for skipping songs.<br />- The speaker is mostly very well built, with the exception of the power switch, which is mushy and cannot be moved with one hand without supporting the unit with the other hand. on my specific speaker the grill isn’t aligned exactly vertically to the sides, but it’s a purely cosmetic issue.<br /><br />If you're looking for a high quality, small and portable way to listen to music with a few friends without breaking the bank, you can’t go wrong with this. If, however, you want to play music for a large group of people or make phone calls using the speakerphone, I’d highly suggest considering something else.<br />The Anker is great for my uses. It is a surpringly good speaker from a company which portable speakers aren’t it’s speciality.",positive,deciding buy anker a7908 looked speakers price point read reviews praised high sound quality extra long 20 hour battery

4,"I'll start off by saying that I am satisfied with this unit. I just wanted something to play music from a USB drive after my auto 6-CD Changer quit. It does a good job with that.  Originally, the lead-in description listed a remote control. I did not get one nor could I figure out how to adjust the advertised (under Features) &#34;Five EQ presets...&#34; Turns out that is adjusted with the remote. When I contacted Amazon they checked things out and told me that this unit is not sold with a remote and gave me an adjustment discount for my trouble. They have since deleted the &#34;Remote&#34; comment in the lead-in. They missed deleting the &#34;EQ presets..&#34; feature comment as of today. Probably didn't know that it needed a remote. I noticed today that there is a feature listed in the early bullet points stating &#34;Hands-free talking function...&#34;. I have no idea how this factors in and functions. Maybe with the remote. I don't need it.  My guess is that some of the wording for the features may be from a different model.  Amazon did a good job at resolving the issues.  That said, if you are looking for a FM transmitter to play from a USB drive, SD card or portable audio device, this fills the bill adequately and with very little  set-up.",positive,start saying satisfied unit wanted play music usb drive auto 6 cd changer quit good job   originally lead

5,"It’s no longer a surprise all Anker products arrive in environmentally safe carton packaging.  As a matter of fact, they were the originators of that trend, quickly followed by most other accessory manufacturers.  The cover sleeve has a nice clean image of the speaker, and after you slide it out and open the box, you will find A7909 model with included accessories.<br /><br />Accessories include a sturdy USB to micro-usb charging cable, 3.5mm to 3.5mm connector (for direct wired connection of the speaker), and a soft storage bag/pouch.  Charging and audio cable is typically something you will find with many other wireless speakers, but not too many others offer a storage bag.  Obviously, a pouch not going to protect your speaker from a high drop, but it could cushion it and provide some level of protection.  Plus, if you leave fingerprints on the plastic surface of the speaker  – a soft material of the pouch could be used to wipe them down.<br /><br />Out of the box, you will find a relatively compact brick shaped speaker with a dimensions of about 6.4” x 2.6” x 2.6” and weighting aproximately280g.  The speaker has a sturdy plastic enclosure with a metal grill on the front covering the drivers and on one side covering the bass port.  On the top you have 2 recessed large volume -/+ buttons to decrease/increase the volume level, and the area for NFC pairing.  Opposite of the bass port on the other side you will find a multi-function Power/Pair-up/Play-Pause button which also has a blue led backlight to indicate when power is on.  The back has charging led indicator, micro-usb charging port, and AUX 3.5mm audio input port.  It’s a very simple design with a clear layout of large easy to use controls.  The bottom has a non-slip rubbery pad for secure placement on any surface.<br /><br />Considering its slightly higher than expected pricing, yeah – Anker spoiled us with premium products at discounted prices, I was curious to explorer its spec and performanceto figure out the value of this BT wireless speaker.  First of all, it comes with a large 6200 mAh battery (that explains the weight) which can support almost 24 hours of playback at 60% volume setting or 18hr playback at a more realistic 70% volume setting.  It sure is impressive for a small compact speaker that isn’t longer than my Note 4.<br /><br />Inside, it has a dual 5W drivers and a dedicated bass port.  Obviously, it could function both wired and wireless.  Wireless pair up with a phone was seamless and I tested it to work 60’ away (!!!) from my phone in open space.  That’s very impressive for a supported wireless distance.  One important thing to keep in mind – it ONLY pairs up with a phone Media, not with a phone to work as a speakerphone.  In my own personal experience with at a least a dozen of BT wireless speakers I have tested, I never ever used any of them as a speakerphone.  Thus, I found a lack of speakerphone support is not a big deal.  The only comment I have here, during pair up speaker produces a loud and a bit annoying beep, which I wish would have been a little quieter.<br /><br />Thanks to its 5W speakers, Anker A7909 BT wireless speaker can get very loud and at the max speaker and phone volume level – I sensed NO distortion what so ever.  Obviously you have to be realistic that small drivers can produce a loud sound but it’s not a powerful room filling type of sound.  The sound is very clean and accurate, not too boomy or too thin, but the further you step away the less bass you hear.  Basically, this is not a type of speaker to entertain a big outdoor party or to fill in a big hall with a loud sound, it's intended for a smaller room listening where louder sound will fill in the room and where you will be able to enjoy better low end (bass) response.<br /><br />Conclusion.<br /><br />Anker usually doesn't disappoint with their new releases, and this new BT wireless speaker is no exception.  It is not necessary the top performeror the best value in &#34;small portable&#34; speaker category, but it definitely offers some unique features to be very competitive.  Battery life which can go up to 24hr is a big bonus.  5W dual speaker is loud and clean, and most important you can raise the volume all the way to the max without clipping or distortion.  And unlike so many other portable speakers with only Volume control, I like the integrated Play/Pause which is SO important.  The whole purpose of wireless speaker is to be away from the phone, and some manufacturers forget about it, making you go back to the phone to pause the song.  I'm glad Anker implemented this feature.  Backed up by their 18-month warranty, this is definitely a good product.  Priced at $69.99, I think it's a bit steep and it would be more realistic to have it priced closer to $50, but if you are looking for all the features offered by this wireless speaker - it worth the price.",positive,longer surprise anker products arrive environmentally safe carton packaging   matter fact originators trend quickly followed accessory ma

One gripe I have is that the side that is pushed against my ear by the pillow is loud enough, but the band is not tight enough to push the other earphone close enough to my ear to drown out the snoring.  However, if it were much tighter I would wake up with marks on my face, so I'm not really sure what the answer would be for me apart from holding a hand or arm to the ear, which is not exactly sleep-inducing.<br /><br />This is a nice, comfortable sleep headband that even covers my eyes a little, which is an added bonus to me.",positive,tried night snores like motorboat husband   took earplugs usually sleep sufficiently loud sweetheart louder   gripe tha

5,"These headphones were just what I needed! I needed some cheap noise canceling headphones and these were great for 55 bucks (Yes, these actually have a noise canceling feature that requires one AAA battery and a switch to turn it on). I went on a trip to South Africa which includes a 17 hour flight. These headphones were great on the plane! They took out the turbine engine sound and allowed me to sleep without so much noise. One AAA battery lasted me the whole trip, there and back (17 hours both ways, and a month in country, using them moderately). People have complained about a bussing when the noise canceling was turned on but I did not hear anything when I first got them and while I used them on the plane. However, now that I've had them for a few months, there is a bussing noise now when the noise canceling is on and I'm not playing anything. There is also a major difference in quality when the noise canceling is turned off and on; the quality is much better with it on. But most headphones in this price range have the same problem. They were also very comfy! I kept them on for hours on the plane and they did not annoy me. But I do have a small head and ears. Overall, these were perfect because they were cheap, comfy, and had good noise canceling for the plane. I only bought them for the one trip and they were worth it!",positive,headphones needed needed cheap noise canceling headphones great 55 bucks yes actually noise canceling feature requires aaa bat

5,"Works good for a $100 set...decent sound for the money. At first, I thought the bluetooth feature didn't work but realized that you have to plug in the included rca cord to the usb dongle, then you're good...for a moment. As other reviewers have reported, the included rca plug is cheap and creates a loud, ugly buzzing (using the bluetooth feature) that can be heard over the music. Using some high quality rca cables got rid of most of the buzzing, but not all of it. Plugging my device straight into the rca cables produced a louder, clearer signal with no buzzing. If you purchase this set, you might have to fool with the remote to familiarize yourself with the various settings, but it's pretty easy after a few minutes. Overall, a rocking little set for a low price.",positive,works good $ 100 set decent sound money thought bluetooth feature work realized plug included rca cord usb dongle

4,"This would be a 5 start review all day for me if the setup was easier.  The speakers themselves put out a great sound for their size so I have no complaints about that.  However set up was a pain, technically.  The app you can download that makes it easy to setup does not work with iPhones using newer software.  It would just keep shutting down!  So I dug up an old iPhone 5 I use as an iPod sometimes and did it through that.  Then it was a breeze.  Stupid complaint, I know, but hopefully you are reading this and can do the right thing right away and avoid the frustration.<br /><br />As far as the speakers themselves?  Forget about it.  They are AWESOME!  I run 2 speakers using AirPlay and it links up 90% of the time with ease.  Sometimes one of the speakers are trying to grab a signal from another computer or iPhone for whatever reason so I will have to go them and push a button but thats hardly an issue to me.  I have had these speakers at times 40' away from my router with no issues.  If you have walls between the speaker though 20' is probably as far as you can go.",positive,5 start review day setup easier   speakers great sound size complaints   set pain tec

5,"Oooh - I purchased my BC-700 on 02/05/15 and absolutely love it (or I did, at least). First, I will note the positives: - very advanced little charger! I had some old, and I mean like 6 years old Energizer rechargables that I was ready to toss in the trash. On a hunch, I decided that the crappy charger I was using just wasn't cutting it, so I decided to invest a couple bucks into a decent charger before scrapping everything and buying a whole new set with batteries. Let me tell you, the refresh cycle on the BC-700 made these old batteries as good as new! I was literally amazed at how well the batteries did, and at how the charger did at displaying the progress the entire time. - Multiple features - Independent charging status - switchable voltages  Now the negative: - my little charger died on me the other day...no more power getting to it :( bummer...I think that it may just be the AC adapter, but this is no ordinary adapter. I found it rather difficult to find a comparable replacement online (3V @ 2.8A) So this is a great opportunity to see how La Crosse Tech's warranty/service is...I registered my charger, then simply contacted them via email to see if they just send me an AC adapter for the charger (likely problem). If they do, then I will easily revise this review to a 5 star product and give them appropriate praise on the twitters...if not, then I will also report my experience and hope for the best.   UPDATE: I wanted to update my review to reflect the great customer service I received! - I'm happy to report that the company sent me a brand new unit free of charge.

4,"The Good:<br />- Great for TV- Much better than sound-bars<br />- Lots of inputs (including 2 optical)<br />- Bass and treble controls.<br />- Remote control.<br />- Very good quality binding posts.<br />- Power transformer built in (no need for power brick).<br />- Speakers look and feel substantial, no cheep plastic here, and they look great.<br />The Bad:<br />- Remote has a very short and narrow range.<br />- Sound will distort at very high volume so it may not be a good choice for a large room (&#62;400 sq-ft)<br />- Speakers go to sleep after long time of inactivity (not sure how long, &#62;  30 min), which is fine, but it won't wake up on signal return, so you need to turn them back on. My solution is a so called 'green' surge protector ( one outlet device power state controls the power to other outlets, this way when the TV is turned on, the speakers turn on)<br />- Binding posts on the left speaker are not deep enough ( the banana plugs are barely half way in)<br /><br />Over all I'm very happy with it.",positive,good:<br />- great tv- better sound bars < br />- lots inputs including 2 optical)<br />- bass treble controls.<br />- remote control.<br />- good quality binding posts.<b

5,"I can't tell if I am getting a bad connection with the dongle, or if it is my stubby fingers are missing the keys. I bought this to use on my PS4 for Final Fantasy 14, and it works great. The size is bigger then I thought it would be. The touch pad makes a great mouse substitute for the PS4, not that it's used much. Though it's a bad thing to have to put down the controller doing a raid to be able to tell your team to watch out for the traps, WHILE fighting monsters, it wasn't designed that that in mind. Anyways, this thing is great and really convenient for people looking for a small keyboard on a USB compatible device.",positive,tell getting bad connection dongle stubby fingers missing keys bought use ps4 final fantasy 14 works great size

5,Pros: Nice transparent window makes it quick to confirm the quality of the design prior to purchasing as well as defective units. Springs seem like will give a more robust connection.  Cons: Like others have said the plastic can melt if soldering isn't done quick enough. The threaded section with the nut won't lock onto materials thicker then 2mm as well. For my intended use these cons are minor.,positive,pros nice transparent window makes quick confirm quality design prior purchasing defective units springs like robust connection   cons like othe
