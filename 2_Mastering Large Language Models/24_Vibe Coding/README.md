# Vibe Coding

coding by prompting the LLM or coding agent

- for prototyping

## Different Ways to Do Vibe Coding

- Using no-code/low-code tools (e.g., v0, Loveable, Bolt) to build applications by describing features or workflows in natural language.
- Leveraging coding agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor) to generate, refactor, or debug code through conversational prompts.
- Integrating LLMs into IDEs to get real-time code suggestions and explanations.
- Using chat-based interfaces (like ChatGPT or Claude) to iteratively develop scripts, functions, or entire applications.
- Employing prompt engineering to guide LLMs for specific coding tasks or automation.
- Combining visual builders with LLMs for UI/UX prototyping and code generation.
- Automating documentation and code comments by asking LLMs to explain or annotate code.

# 2 ways

1. i can use any no code tool - v0, loveable, bolt,
2. coding agents in our coding environment - copilot (we already using it in VS code), claude code, cursor

Assignment
Create a full stack application using loveable.dev

(use a real world use case from your industry)


steps
1. create a prompt using chatGPT, grok, claude
2. paste that prompt in loveable
3. integrate your supabase account for database
4. publish it, 
5. share in the whatsapp group and linkedin profile
